# Simple Self Hosted Terraform Cloud agent on GKE

## Overview

This example shows how to deploy Terraform Cloud agents on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the `tfc-agent-gke` module.

It creates the Terraform Cloud agent pool, registers the agent to that pool and creates a project and an empty workspace with the agent attached.

## Prerequisites

The tools needed to build this example are available by default in Google Cloud Shell.

If running from your own system, you will need:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

## Steps to deploy this example

1. Create terraform.tfvars file with the necessary values.

    The Terraform Cloud agent token you would like to use. NOTE: This is a secret and should be marked as sensitive in Terraform Cloud.

    ```tf
    project_id   = "your-project-id"
    tfc_org_name = "your-tfc-org-name"
    ```

1. Create the infrastructure.

    ```sh
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

1. Your Terraform Cloud agents should become active at Organization Setting > Security > Agents.

1. Create additonal workspaces or use the existing workspace to run Terraform through the Terraform Cloud agent. [Click here for more info on running the workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest/docs/resources/workspace_run#example-usage).
